# RealPDE Track 2 LTTTA Starting Kit v6

This kit contains the minimal files to build a Codabench submission for Track 2:
Long-Term Test-Time Adaptation on streaming real-world PIV data.

> **Repo layout note:** this working copy reorganizes the original flat kit
> into a scalable structure so new ideas don't require touching packaging code:
> - `shared/` — code that never changes per idea: `load_baseline.py`,
>   `rpde_baselines/` (vendored CNO/FNO/Transolver), `checkpoints/`.
> - `variants/<name>/` — one folder per idea, `submission.py` (+ optional
>   `policy.yaml`) only. Currently `baseline_reference` (the org's reference
>   template) and `agentic_rule` (the org's agentic demo).
> - `make_submission.py` — assembles `shared/` + `variants/<name>/` into
>   `build/<name>.zip`, running `local_eval.py` and a zip-contract check first.
>   See `python3 make_submission.py --help`.
>
> The file descriptions below describe the **original** kit paths
> (`submission_template.py`, `agentic_demo/`, etc.) for reference; where they
> now live is noted inline.

## Files

- `submission_template.py`: fill this in to create your `submission.py`. Includes
  a correct prev-target adaptation reference implementation.
- `ttt_model.py`: optional convenience base class for the TTT interface.
- `local_eval.py`: run a CPU smoke test against the bundled `example_data`, and
  report the real subscores using the bundled `scoring.py`.
- `scoring.py`: the official scoring program (the exact leaderboard formulas).
  Run it yourself on real data, or let `local_eval.py` call it.
- `pack_ckpt_fp16.py`: pack an fp32 checkpoint to fp16 to fit the size limit.
- `load_baseline.py`: build CNO / FNO / Transolver and load an official
  checkpoint, ready to wrap as your TTT base model (see "Baseline Models").
- `rpde_baselines/`: vendored baseline model code (renamed so it never shadows
  the evaluator's own `realpdebench` package); imports offline.
- `agentic_demo/`: submittable agentic baseline (bounded controller +
  optional gateway LLM), adapted from
  [agentic_LTTTA](https://github.com/PgUpDn/agentic_LTTTA); see its README.
- `docs/interface.md`, `docs/metrics.md`: interface contract and metric summary.
- `example_data/`: two tiny synthetic trajectories + the official normalization
  stats, for local shape checks only (regenerate with `example_data/make_example.py`).

## Interface

`submission.py` must define:

```python
def get_ttt_model(submission_dir, device):
    ...  # return an object with reset_ttt_state() and ttt_step()
```

The returned object implements:

- `reset_ttt_state()`: called at each trajectory start; restore checkpoint
  weights, clear adaptation state.
- `ttt_step(input_norm, prev_target_norm=None)`: called once per step, batch
  size 1, on `(1, 20, 32, 64, 3)` normalized tensors. `prev_target_norm` is the
  ground truth of the previous step (`None` on the first step). Return
  `(pred_norm, info)`; the evaluator reads `info["adapt_loss"]` (a python float
  or `None`) and, optionally, `info["lower"]` / `info["upper"]` for the Safe
  Prediction Score. Any other key is ignored.

Evaluation is duck-typed, so subclassing `ttt_model.py` is optional. See
`docs/interface.md` for the full contract.

## Local Smoke Test

`local_eval.py` mirrors the official streaming loop (trajectory resets,
prev-target passing, per-step timing) on the bundled example data, then feeds the
predictions through the bundled `scoring.py` to print the five real subscores. It
uses the same subscore formulas the leaderboard uses, but the numbers on the tiny
synthetic example data are illustrative only: point `--data` at real downloaded
data for comparable scores, and note `time_score` reflects your local wall time.

The leaderboard combines them into a single `final_score`; that combination is
not published, so no total is printed here.

```bash
# run any variant directly against local_eval.py
python local_eval.py --submission variants/baseline_reference
python local_eval.py --submission variants/agentic_rule

# or build + verify a Codabench-ready zip in one step (recommended)
python make_submission.py --variant agentic_rule
```

`local_eval.py` mirrors the evaluator's streaming loop (the evaluator itself is
not downloadable); for the exact submission contract, `docs/interface.md` is
authoritative.

## Evaluation Sandbox

Your model runs out-of-process in an isolated subprocess. It reads your
submission archive and the Python runtime normally, writes freely (temp files,
caches, checkpoints), and uses torch / CUDA / numpy as usual. Only the hidden
evaluation data (ground truth) is unreadable from disk: any attempt to open it
is denied by the kernel. You never need it, because `ttt_step` is handed the
normalized input and previous target directly. Of the `info` dict you return,
the evaluator keeps `adapt_loss` and the optional `lower` / `upper` bounds; put
nothing else load-bearing in it.

## Timing

Everything inside `ttt_step` is timed: adaptation on the previous pair,
controller logic, optional LLM round-trips, and the forward pass. `reset_ttt_state`
is timed too, charged to the step after the boundary, so moving work between the
two changes nothing. Model construction and checkpoint loading are **not** timed;
they run once before the stream. The Time score uses the mean per-step wall time. A separate 10-minute wall-clock
execution limit covers the whole run (loading included), so keep loading modest.

## Submission Size

The extracted archive (checkpoint included) must stay under **256 MB**. If your
fp32 checkpoint is too large, pack it to fp16:

```bash
python pack_ckpt_fp16.py model_fp32.pth model.pth
```

The tool handles complex tensors safely; see its docstring for the matching
`unpack_fp16` load helper.

## Baseline Models (pretrained checkpoints)

The kit vendors the official baseline model code (`rpde_baselines/`: CNO, FNO,
Transolver) plus `load_baseline.py`. `einops` (needed by the Transolver
forward) is already installed in the Track 2 evaluation image, so there is
nothing extra to ship.

Checkpoints are on the competition Google Drive (folder `baseline_checkpoints/`
inside the data release, id `1Cg23DoTuSvWXR3Mm1uRfmMNAbkyaIhrQ`; not shipped in
this kit):

```
baseline_checkpoints/
├── sim_pretrain/          # sim-only pretraining
│   ├── sim_cno.pth
│   ├── sim_fno.pth
│   ├── sim_fno_fp16.pth   # fp16-packed FNO (fits the 256 MB cap)
│   └── sim_transolver.pth
└── sim_real_ft/           # fine-tuned on real PIV data (best starting point)
    ├── sim_real_cno.pth
    ├── sim_real_fno.pth
    ├── sim_real_fno_fp16.pth
    └── sim_real_transolver.pth
```

Sizes: CNO 32 MB, Transolver 50 MB, FNO 403 MB (fp32) / 201 MB (fp16-packed).
Only FNO needs fp16 packing to fit under the 256 MB submission cap.

Use one as the base model your TTT method adapts:

```python
from load_baseline import load_baseline, make_example_input
from submission_template import ReferenceTTTModel

base, meta = load_baseline("sim_real_cno.pth")     # type auto-detected
model = ReferenceTTTModel(base, device="cpu")      # adapts base in ttt_step

x = make_example_input("example_data/test_real/5025_5.h5")  # (1,20,32,64,3)
y = base(x)                                                 # (1,20,32,64,3)
```

The example call is a raw-space shape check; during evaluation `ttt_step`
receives tensors already normalized with the official stats, which is the space
the checkpoints were trained in. Geometry: channels `[u, v, p]` (p = 0),
`T_in = T_out = 20`, eval resolution `32 x 64` (the kit example h5 stores raw
`64 x 128`; `make_example_input(..., sub_s=2)` handles the subsampling).

## Training Data

The example data here is for shape checks only. The full training release
(simulated pretraining + real finetuning trajectories) is on Google Drive:
[NeurIPS 2026 RealPDE Competition data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cg23DoTuSvWXR3Mm1uRfmMNAbkyaIhrQ).
Track 1 and Track 2 share the same release.

## LLM Access

Optional LLM calls must go through the organizer-provided gateway. The endpoint,
the model name and a code example are on the competition Submission page. Direct
network access and your own API keys are prohibited, and LLM latency counts
toward Time. The numbers in `agentic_demo/policy.yaml` are that demo's own, not
gateway limits.

## Agentic Baseline

`agentic_demo/` is a submittable adaptation of the agentic-LTTTA baseline
([github.com/PgUpDn/agentic_LTTTA](https://github.com/PgUpDn/agentic_LTTTA)):
a bounded controller (skip / recalibrate / update-adapter) driven by an
offline-tuned `policy.yaml`, with optional online LLM action selection through
the organizer gateway (auto-detected from the injected `OPENAI_*` environment,
safe fallback to the rule policy). Run `python local_eval.py --submission
agentic_demo`, and see `agentic_demo/README.md` for how it maps the upstream
offline-design / online-execution demos onto the official Track 2 protocol.
